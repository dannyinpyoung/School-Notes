    "2. The implementation of the framework would take place beginning in 2013 and being fully implemented in January 1, 2019. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What is the concern/problem?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Meeting BASEL III meant going through urdles of regulatory challenges starting 2013 that would change the banking sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Investors concerned that to meet capital requirements, the bank would raise capital to meet the requirements and dilute existing shares (amidst declining industry profits). Existing sovereign debt issues plaguing EU also added to this.  \n",
