    "### \"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility: Macroprudential Tools at Work in Canada, Ivo Krznar and James Morsink \" \n",
    "link to article: [click here](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2014/wp1483.pdf) <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "__INTRODUCTION__\n",
    "* Insured mortgages have lower risk weights than uninsured loans. \n",
    "* Capital risk weight of zero for CMHC insured mortgages under standardized approach and 0.5% risk for sovereign exposures. \n",
    "* Mortgages insured by private insurers riskier (2-7.5%) \n",
    "* Uninsured risk weights around (7-25%). \n",
    "* There is no dominant state-owned mortgage lender/no dominant government-sponsored enterprises to buy large share of the mortgage loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "__III. Great Responsibility: Macroprudential Tools at Work__ \n",
    "\n",
    "__A. Policy Developments__ \n",
    "* Mortgage insurance is important.\n",
    "* Used in countercyclical fashion. \n",
    "* Rules loosened when housing markets were booming in mid 2000s (bad sign). \n",
    "* Insurance rules loosened made insured mortgages more affordaable. \n",
    "* **The catalysts included**:\n",
    "   * Measures included a broadening of the eligible sources of funds for the minimum down payment\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum LTV ratio that triggers mandatory insurance to 80 percent\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum LTV ratio for any new government backed insured loans to 100 percent\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum amortization period from 25 to 40 years; and providing insurance on interest-only mortgages and on mortgages to the self-employed\n",
    "* ALong with tightening mortgage insurance rules:\n",
    "    * microprudential measures: Decrease LTV to 95%\n",
    "    * Oversight of mortgages insurers. \n",
    "    * Limits on MBS and CMHC securitization. Prohibit use of government-backed insured mortgages in non-cmhc securitization programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "__B. Assessing the Effectiveness of Macroprudential Measures__\n",
    "* Estimate two separate equations for mortgage credit and house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_t = \\alpha + \\beta X_t + \\gamma D_{t}^i + \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * $Y_t$ is mortgage credit or house price YoY growth.\n",
    "    * $X_t$ is a matrix of control variables (Current and lagged)\n",
    "    * $D_{t}^i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 in months following implementation of a set of measure i where i represents a specific set of macroprudential measures. \n",
    "* The model found that 2nd,3rd, and 4th rounds of measures helped to limit the increase in household leverage and house prices. \n",
    "* Evidence suggests that last 3 rounds of measures dampened mortgage credit growth aand house prices. \n",
    "* Reducing mortgage growth, tightening of mortgage insurance rules also dampened house price growth. \n",
    "* Tightening LTVs for new mortgage and for refinancing loans had the largest impact. \n",
    "* While debt to income ratio increased, it would've been higher otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "__IV. What If More Needs To Be Done__ \n",
    "* Caps on LTV. \n",
    "* DTI ratio and provisioning requirement and risk weights. \n",
    "* DTI ratio is mainly used to constrain huseholds capacity to borrow. \n",
    "* Provisions increasing in an upturn can constrain credit of the bank and also withstand lossess upon a downturn. \n",
    "* __Four Main Macroprudential Measures__\n",
    "    1. Limits on LTV\n",
    "    2. Caaps to debt to income ratio\n",
    "    3. Greater risk weights for banks' credit assets\n",
    "    4. Higher provisioning requirements for banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* LTV, DTI, and risk weights can be effective measures for containing mortgage credit and house prices growth. Quarterly credit growth is lower by 1/2 ~ 3/4 percentage points on average during the period of tightening. \n",
    "* The reason for those effects is most likely due to direct impacts on a bank's balance sheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "__V. Housing Finance Reform Over The Medium Term__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit risk transfeer to taxpapers: Advantages of government-backed mortgage insurance. \n",
    "    (i) Explicit allocation of losses which encourages actions to mitigate the risks. \n",
    "    (ii) Macroprudential tool (Mortgage insurance rules)\n",
    "    (iii) A small vehicle for small mortgage lenders to obtain funding. \n",
    "* Some of the issues with government backed mortgage insurance: \n",
    "    (i) Substantial risk tothe tax payer. \n",
    "    (ii) Not a level playing ground for mortgage insurers (private). \n",
    "    (iii) Inefficient allocation of resources. \n",
    "* A solution can be to grow the share of private insurers. Another solution could be risk sharing. Mortgage insurance could be limited to be the first 10-30% of the outstanding balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Conclusion__\n",
    "* One % lower in max LTV => reduces mortgage credit growth by about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points. \n",
    "* Higher DT and higher risk weights could be an effective measure of slowing down mortgage credit growth. \n",
    "* Key vulnerabilities in the economy are high household debt and elevated house prices. \n",
    "* Considering to eliminate the role of government mortgagee insurance can be taken into consideration. \n",

    "    * Imbalances in Caanadian household finances. \n",
    "* When liquidity risk and spillover effects are considered in addition to solvency risk, they find that capital positions of banks decline by 20%. \n",
    "* Important for establishing boundaries in stress testing \n",
    "* Spill over effects are when banks run insolvency and are unable to pay their interbank counterparts. \n",
    "* Refer to the articlef or the model. \n",

    "changes in net worth, and eliciting responses from financial intermediaries who adjust the size of their balance sheets. We document evidence that marked-to-market leverage is strongly\n",
    "procyclical. Such behavior has aggregate consequences. Changes\n",

    "\n",
    "* Marked to market leverage is strongly procyclical. \n",
    "* Aggregate liquidity can be seen as the rate of change of the aggregate balance sheet of intermediaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Introduction__\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that volatility risk premium is defined by the difference between VIX index and realized volatility*\n",
    "\n",
    "* We should expect to see a negative related change between leverage and changes in balance sheet size\n",
    "* Focuses on reactions of financial intermediaries to changes in their net worth and market wide consequences. Expects passivee intermediaries but sees strong relationship with leverage and chagne in BS. \n",
    "* High leverage during booms => Low leverage during busts. \n",
    "* Could be result of active management. \n",
    "* Looks at brokers and shows leverage is procyclical and that margin of adjustment on balance sheet is through repos and reverse repos. \n",
    "* Changes in borrowing and lending are significant forecasting variables for innovations in VIX or implied volatility in the stock market. \n",
    "* Financial liquidity can be understood as the rate of growth of aggregate balance sheets. As intermediaries assets rise, leverage falls, intermediaries hold surplus capital. Liabilities consist of more short term borrowing. \n",
    "* Liquidity is tied to how hard intermediaries look for borrowers\n",
    "* We note that leverage = A/(A-debt) has a negative relationship. Passive intermediaries should exhibit this. \n",
    "* Commerciaal banks appear to be targeting a fixed leverage ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Note the following equation:__\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a firm wants to have a target leverage ratio they will take on D amount of debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Assets/Equity = \\frac{101+D}{11} = 10 $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the inverse, the company can sell off equity to raise (note denominator would be equity or asset - debt)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why does this work?__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If fin markets are not perf liquid: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\uparrow$ Asset Price $\\Rightarrow$ $\\uparrow$ Leverage  $\\Rightarrow$ $\\uparrow$ purchases of asset $\\Rightarrow$ $\\uparrow$ Asset Price\n",
    "\n",
    "Stronger Balance Sheet $\\Rightarrow$ Adjusts Leverage $\\Rightarrow$ Increase B/S size $\\Rightarrow$ Asset price boom $\\Rightarrow$ Stronger Balance Sheet\n",
    "\n",
    "OR \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaker balance Sheet $\\Rightarrow$ Adjusts Leverage $\\Rightarrow$ Reduce BS size $\\Rightarrow$ Asset price decline. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The reason we look at investment banks is that they tend to have short-term debt to fund assets which suggests values that are closer to a marked-to-market value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Leverage is negatively related with VaR\n",
    "\n",
    "__Leverage Regression Results__ \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assets positively related. \n",
    "2. Repos positively related. \n",
    "3. Trading VaR negatively related. \n",

    "109-235 observations, $R^2$ only high (62%) for 1 whereas the others are $5-24\\%$. FE estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What is a repo and why does it matter?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* Repurchase agreement: fin inst sells security on understanding it will buy it back at a pre-agreed price on a fixed future date. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Essential for collateralized loan. Interest on loan in excess of repo price over the sale price. \n",
    "* From the perspective of the lender, the party who buys the security with the undertaking to re-sell it later is called a reverse repo. \n",
    "* From the perspective of the buyer, it is equivalent to granting a loan on collateral. \n",
    "* Why does this increase liquidity? As a dealer who takes a short position will borrow the needed security and provide cash or other securities as collateral. Closes out position by buying the borrowed security. In the case of a long, if a broker cannot purchase a position in equity, they will borrow  and usually uses the purchased security as collateral for the cash borrowing. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Value at Risk__ \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Prob (A < A_0 - VaR) \\leq 1-c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* A is a RV\n",
    "* c is th econfidence interval\n",
    "* $A_0$ is the smallest non-negative number VaR such that the above holds true. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example: A can be the total marked to marked assets, which then the equation tells us the equity capital that the firm must hold to stay solvent with a probability c. \n",
    "\n",
    "VaR is informative of leverage. Paper conjectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ K = \\lambda \\times VaR$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lambda is the proportion of capital that intermediary holds per unit of VaR. \n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage satisfies: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\frac{A}{K} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\times \\frac{A}{VaR} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\times \\frac{1}{V}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* V is the unit value at risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that leverage increases as the total assets per unit of VaR decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This effect is negative with leverage (if it is not clear already)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Forecasting Risk Appetite__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Looks at primary dealers (investment banks) and foreign banks that own broker dealers. Look at weekly daata that shows positions, financing, and settlement data of the dealers in fixed income markets. \n",
    "* Reverse repos and repos => Security Financing Data\n",
    "* Distinguishes securities in and securities out for each class. \n",
    "* Repo would be securities out since it borrows funds and provides securities as a collateral. \n",
    "\n",
    "Results: \n",
    "* Growth rates of repos => Forecasts innovations in the VIX. \n",
    "* Negative relationship between implied volatility with reverse repos and negative with net repos. \n",
    "* Negative relationshipw with volatility risk premium.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Conclusion__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate liquidity can be understood as the rate of growth of the aggregate financial sector balance sheet. When asset prices increase, financial intermediaries’ balance sheets generally become\n",
    "stronger, and – without adjusting asset holdings – their leverage tends to be too low. The financial\n",
    "intermediaries then hold surplus capital, and they will attempt to find ways in which they can employ\n",
    "their surplus capital. In analogy with manufacturing firms, we may see the financial system as having\n",
    "‘‘surplus capacity”. For such surplus capacity to be utilized, the intermediaries must expand their balance sheets. On the liability side, they take on more short-term debt. On the asset side, they search for\n",
    "potential borrowers. Aggregate liquidity is intimately tied to how hard the financial intermediaries\n",
    "search for borrowers. In the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States we have seen that when\n",
    "balance sheets are expanding fast enough, even borrowers that do not have the means to repay are\n",
    "granted credit – so intense is the urge to employ surplus capital. The seeds of the subsequent downturn in the credit cycle are thus sown."
