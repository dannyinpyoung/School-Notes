    "__INTRODUCTION__\n",
    "* Insured mortgages have lower risk weights than uninsured loans. \n",
    "* Capital risk weight of zero for CMHC insured mortgages under standardized approach and 0.5% risk for sovereign exposures. \n",
    "* Mortgages insured by private insurers riskier (2-7.5%) \n",
    "* Uninsured risk weights around (7-25%). \n",
    "* There is no dominant state-owned mortgage lender/no dominant government-sponsored enterprises to buy large share of the mortgage loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "__III. Great Responsibility: Macroprudential Tools at Work__ \n",
    "\n",
    "__A. Policy Developments__ \n",
    "* Mortgage insurance is important.\n",
    "* Used in countercyclical fashion. \n",
    "* Rules loosened when housing markets were booming in mid 2000s (bad sign). \n",
    "* Insurance rules loosened made insured mortgages more affordaable. \n",
    "* **The catalysts included**:\n",
    "   * Measures included a broadening of the eligible sources of funds for the minimum down payment\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum LTV ratio that triggers mandatory insurance to 80 percent\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum LTV ratio for any new government backed insured loans to 100 percent\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum amortization period from 25 to 40 years; and providing insurance on interest-only mortgages and on mortgages to the self-employed\n",
    "* ALong with tightening mortgage insurance rules:\n",
    "    * microprudential measures: Decrease LTV to 95%\n",
    "    * Oversight of mortgages insurers. \n",
    "    * Limits on MBS and CMHC securitization. Prohibit use of government-backed insured mortgages in non-cmhc securitization programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "__B. Assessing the Effectiveness of Macroprudential Measures__\n",
    "* Estimate two separate equations for mortgage credit and house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_t = \\alpha + \\beta X_t + \\gamma D_{t}^i + \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * $Y_t$ is mortgage credit or house price YoY growth.\n",
    "    * $X_t$ is a matrix of control variables (Current and lagged)\n",
    "    * $D_{t}^i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 in months following implementation of a set of measure i where i represents a specific set of macroprudential measures. \n",
    "* The model found that 2nd,3rd, and 4th rounds of measures helped to limit the increase in household leverage and house prices. \n",
    "* Evidence suggests that last 3 rounds of measures dampened mortgage credit growth aand house prices. \n",
    "* Reducing mortgage growth, tightening of mortgage insurance rules also dampened house price growth. \n",
    "* Tightening LTVs for new mortgage and for refinancing loans had the largest impact. \n",
    "* While debt to income ratio increased, it would've been higher otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "__IV. What If More Needs To Be Done__ \n",
    "* Caps on LTV. \n",
    "* DTI ratio and provisioning requirement and risk weights. \n",
    "* DTI ratio is mainly used to constrain huseholds capacity to borrow. \n",
    "* Provisions increasing in an upturn can constrain credit of the bank and also withstand lossess upon a downturn. \n",
    "* __Four Main Macroprudential Measures__\n",
    "    1. Limits on LTV\n",
    "    2. Caaps to debt to income ratio\n",
    "    3. Greater risk weights for banks' credit assets\n",
    "    4. Higher provisioning requirements for banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* LTV, DTI, and risk weights can be effective measures for containing mortgage credit and house prices growth. Quarterly credit growth is lower by 1/2 ~ 3/4 percentage points on average during the period of tightening. \n",
    "* The reason for those effects is most likely due to direct impacts on a bank's balance sheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "__V. Housing Finance Reform Over The Medium Term__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit risk transfeer to taxpapers: Advantages of government-backed mortgage insurance. \n",
    "    (i) Explicit allocation of losses which encourages actions to mitigate the risks. \n",
    "    (ii) Macroprudential tool (Mortgage insurance rules)\n",
    "    (iii) A small vehicle for small mortgage lenders to obtain funding. \n",
    "* Some of the issues with government backed mortgage insurance: \n",
    "    (i) Substantial risk tothe tax payer. \n",
    "    (ii) Not a level playing ground for mortgage insurers (private). \n",
    "    (iii) Inefficient allocation of resources. \n",
    "* A solution can be to grow the share of private insurers. Another solution could be risk sharing. Mortgage insurance could be limited to be the first 10-30% of the outstanding balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Conclusion__\n",
    "* One % lower in max LTV => reduces mortgage credit growth by about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points. \n",
    "* Higher DT and higher risk weights could be an effective measure of slowing down mortgage credit growth. \n",
    "* Key vulnerabilities in the economy are high household debt and elevated house prices. \n",
    "* Considering to eliminate the role of government mortgagee insurance can be taken into consideration. \n",

    "## Bank activity and funding strategies: The impact on risk and returns\n",
    "* Authors: Asli Demirguc-Kunt, Harry Huizinga \n",
    "* Publication: Jounral of Financial Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper examines the implications of bank activity and short-term funding strategies for bank risk and return using an international sample of 1,334 banks in 101 countries leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Expansion into noninterest income-generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it could offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Nondeposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of nondeposit funding. A sizable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of nondeposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility. Overall, banking strategies that rely prominently on generating noninterest income or attracting nondeposit funding are very risky, consistent with the demise of the US investment banking sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Funding short-term strategies with trading increases inherent risk of the assets being funded. \n",
    "* This comes at the cost of bank fragility. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks have diversified their product offerings by consolidating businesses that were otherwise independent. For example, investment banks stood alone in their own business. Now, we see investment banks owned by large banks, along with commercial banks and insurance firms. This allows to diversify against adverse shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks that were the most deeply in trouble were the ones that generated substantial noninterest income through trading of, for instance, MBS or relied on wholesale capital markets for their funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large fast growing banks tend to have higher non-interest income and nondeposit funding shares. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Paper objective is to provide evidence on what funding strategies and bank income perform well in terms of producing profitable and stable banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Suggests that low levels of noninterest income and nondeposit funding, there oculd be some risk diversification benefits of icnreases these shares. Higher levels of noninterest income and nondeposit shares, further increases bank risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "* IV Regression: Paper instruments for bank income and funding mixes as a proxy for bank-specific banking powers and allowed activities. Risk outcomes and funding strategies and return outcomes can be determined simultaneously. \n",
    "    * Results show that higher noninterest income or nondeposit funding share engenders a materially higher bank risk, but the impact of either variable on the ROA is difficult to establish due to endogeneity. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Banking strategies that rely on noninterest income or nondeposit funding are very risky. \n",

    "## CoCos: a primer\n",
    "* Authors: Stefan Avdjiev, Anastasia Kartasheva, Bilyana Bogdanova\n",
    "* Publication: Bank for International Settlements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract / Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingent convertible capital instruments (CoCos) are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level. In this article, we go over the structure of CoCos, trace the evolution of their issuance, and examine their pricing in primary and secondary markets. CoCo issuance is primarily driven by their potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. The bulk of the demand for CoCos has come from small\n",
    "investors, while institutional investors have been relatively restrained so far. The spreads of CoCos over other subordinated debt greatly depend on their two main design characteristics – the trigger level and the loss absorption mechanism. CoCo spreads are more correlated with the spreads of other subordinated debt than with CDS spreads and equity prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cocos address the problem of a lack of incentive for private investors to provide additional capital in times of distress, which at that point governments use tax-payer money and distorts the incentives of bankers. \n",
    "* When the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level, debt level is lowered. \n",
    "* Looks at dataset that covers 70bn worth of CoCos issued between June 2009 and June 2013. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for issuing CoCos \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Satisfies regulatory capital requirements \n",
    "2. Demand comes from private banks and retail investors. \n",
    "3. Tend to yield more thna higher ranked debt and are highly dependent on trigger level and loss absorption. \n",
    "4. CoCos tend to be more correlated with those of other subordinated debt than with CDS spreads and equity prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and design of CoCos \n",
    "\n",
    "__Requirements__ \n",
    "* They need to absorb lossess prior or at the point of insolvency. \n",
    "* The loss absorption mechanism must be a function fo the capitalisation levels of thee issuing bank. \n",
    "* Robust to price manipulation and speculative attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "__TWO MAIN DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS__ \n",
    "1. Loss absorption mechanism\n",
    "    * Converting into common equity or by suffering a principal writedown. \n",
    "2. Trigger to activate that mechanism \n",
    "    * Trigger can be mechanical (defined in terms of capital ratio) or discretionary (supervisory judgement).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on mechanical rules or supervisors' discretion.\n",
    "    * EG: Capital falls below a certain % of RWA. Can be based on book value or market value. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Accounting Triggers_: Book value triggers. Set contractually based on BV of CET1 capital as a ratio of RWA. Depends heavily on the frequency of disclosure and calculations. May not be activated in a timely manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Market-Value Trigger_: Set to min ratio at the bank's stock market cap to its assets. Reduces scope for sheet manipulation and regulatory forbearance. Subject to stock price manipulation. Dilutive conversion rate makes it possible for more than one pair of equity prices to exist for any combination of bank asset values and non-CoCo debt levels => double equilibria problem. There is also an incentive to shortsell underlying asset to trigger. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Discretionary Triggers_: Point of non-viability (PONV) triggers are triggered based on supervisors' judgement about the bank's solvency prospects. Unless disclosure is made clear, uncertainty around timing looms over. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Structure of Cocos](CoCos_Structurepng.png \"CoCos Structure\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss absorption Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "CoCos boost the bank's equity in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conversion-to-equity CoCo: Turns into CET1 at a pre-defined conversion rate. \n",
    "    i. Conversion rate based on market price of stock at time triggered.\n",
    "    ii. Pre-specified price. \n",
    "    iii. Combination of the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Principal Writedown (PWD): CoCo raises equity by incurring a writedown. \n",
    "    * Full or partial writedown feature. EG: 75% FV and 25% cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that CE CoCos with a combination would incentivize existing equity holders to avoid a breach of the trigger while preventing unlimited dilution. (i causes dilution, ii lacks incentive to avoid triggers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CoCo Issuance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Under Basel III, qualifies as either AT1 or T2 capital. \n",
    "    * Requires a PONV trigger requirement. \n",
    "    * Requires a going-concern contingent capital requirement, which only applies to AT1 instruments classified as liabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Basel III CoCos](CoCo_BaselIII.png \"CoCo Basel III\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selection for trigger is a tradeoff between regulatory capital eligibility considerations and costs of issuance. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lower triggers => usually less likely to qualify as AT1 capital (since lower loss absorbency). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Minimum trigger as AT1 capital is 5.125%__\n",
    "\n",
    "* AT1 instruments must be perpetual, that is why a third of all CoCos have no maturity date. Dated maturity CoCos are T2. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Capital eligibility considerations not as important in the selection of loss absorption mechanisms__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* CE is more popular.\n",
    "    * Usually cheaper issuance than PWD. \n",
    "* Tax implications across jurisdictions vary with CoCos. Some see it as debt, in which interest expense is associated. \n",
    "\n",
    "* 64% of CoCos are tax-deductible, 20% are not, 16% under review. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Investors in CoCos \n",
    "\n",
    "* Retail investors and small private banks primarily. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of completee consistent ratings is the primary issue supressing growth of the investor base. \n",

    "* AM companies ( 27% of demand )\n",
    "* Hedge Funds ( 9% of demand )\n",
    "* Banks ( 3% of demand )\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors influencing the size of the CoCo investor base\n",
    "\n",
    "* Absence of credit ratings. Institutional invesetors are against mandates that prevent them from holding instruments without credit ratings. Three main factors why there are no ratings: \n",
    "    * Heterogeneity across jurisdictions. \n",
    "    * High-trigger CoCos can invert the hierarchy of investors. \n",
    "    * Discretionary triggers create valuation uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually rated much lower than subordinated debt and senior unsecured debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Diversification benefits if tail risk has low correlation with the portfolios of CoCo bondholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary market pricing of CoCos\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Determinants of Pricing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trigger\n",
    "2. Loss absorption mechanism\n",
    "3. Capital structure of the bank \n",

    "\n",
    "* Authors: Chris D'Souza and Toni Gravelle from BOC, Walter Engert and Liane Orsi from OSFI. \n",
    "* Publication: Bank of Canada and OSFI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Policy makers were unwilling to allow institutions to fail. \n",
    "* Concerns arose regarding excessive risk-taking behaviour by protected institutions. \n",
    "* Paper looks at two potential resolutions of failing banks: contingent capital and bail-in debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Contingent Capital and Bail-In Debt? \n",
    "\n",
    "_Contingent Capital_: Subordinated security, similar to that of a preferred share or subordinated debenture, that converts to common equity under certain conditions. => Conversion terms are set out in the contracts made between the issuer and investor. Require payment for taking on the risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Bail-In Debt_: Contractual mechanism extended beyond the regulatory capital base to senior debt securities of the issuing bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Gone-Concern and Going-concern Contingent Instruments__\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingent Capital is categorized into two main types of instruments: \n",
    "\n",
    "_Gone-Concern_: Supervisor determines whether the financial condition (or PONV) warrents conversion to common equity. Offers itself to the resolution framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Going-Concern_: Converts before PoNV. Usually if capital ratio hits a certain point or share price falls below a certain level or aggregate banking sector falls. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regulatory context matters\n",
    "\n",
    "With gone-concern capital, the incentives of the supervisor and resolution authority to intervene in a timely manner matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going-concern => works to exercise forebearance. Tendency of som esupervisors to accomodate troubled institutions and to refrain from intervening with corrective measures. Usually happens due to lack of incentives or power to intervene effectively as the bank deteriorates. Basically, reduces supervisory forebearance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives of gone-concern contingent instruments \n",
    "\n",
    "Gone-concern contingent capital and bain-in debt share two objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) To support the resolution of a failing bank by providing sources of capital when the institution cannot recapitalize through private markets; and \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) to ensure that equity holders and other providers of regulatory capital, as well as major creditors of banks, face risk of loss, even if the troubled bank is not closed and liquidated. \n",
    "\n",
    "These mechanisms can reduce the liklihood of a bailout and reduce cost to taxpayers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How would gone-concern contingent instruments help resolution? \n",
    "\n",
    "We first note the conditions for conversion: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Reach PoNV; or\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Public sector provides capital, without which the bank would not be viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gone-concern capital might not be enough to generate sufficient capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at bail-in debt: \n",
    "* Could increase the private sector capital available at PoNV. \n",
    "* Most senior debt would tend to be unchanged if conversion triggered. \n",
    "* We could use both bail-in and contingent instruments, alongside existing prudential capital requirements, for restoration requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-viability and supervisory discretion\n",
    "\n",
    "The OSFI can intervene and essentially act as a supervisor if, under discretion, finds a bank to be failing. Can activate trigger on their own discretion. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Several issues concerning contingent capital and bail-in senior debt require further analysis, including the precise form of any prudential rules to bring these mechanisms into effect; the amount of such contingent instruments to require; and the determination of the period over which such requirements would become binding. Other issues include how these mechanisms would relate to other tools in the regulators’ resolution toolkit; their incentive effects on market participants, including when conversion seems likely; and the implications for investors holding instruments that are not subject to conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues should be addressed as policy-makers around the world continue to debate the set of tools to be included in an effective framework for bank resolution. The framework should recognize the possibility that financial firms can fail, and that they need to be resolved efficiently, in a way that minimizes disruption to the wider economy and reduces the risk of moral hazard. Relying on higher prudential requirements for common equity is undoubtedly part of the solution, as was recently proposed by the Basel Committee. In addition, contingent capital and bail-in debt could improve the capacity of the private sector to contribute to the resolution of failing banks while reducing risks to the public sector and improving the incentives that condition market behaviour."
