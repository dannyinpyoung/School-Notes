    "\n",
    "__INTRODUCTION__\n",
    "* Insured mortgages have lower risk weights than uninsured loans. \n",
    "* Capital risk weight of zero for CMHC insured mortgages under standardized approach and 0.5% risk for sovereign exposures. \n",
    "* Mortgages insured by private insurers riskier (2-7.5%) \n",
    "* Uninsured risk weights around (7-25%). \n",
    "* There is no dominant state-owned mortgage lender/no dominant government-sponsored enterprises to buy large share of the mortgage loans. \n",
    "\n",
    "__III. Great Responsibility: Macroprudential Tools at Work__ \n",
    "\n",
    "__A. Policy Developments__ \n",
    "* Mortgage insurance is important.\n",
    "* Used in countercyclical fashion. \n",
    "* Rules loosened when housing markets were booming in mid 2000s (bad sign). \n",
    "* Insurance rules loosened made insured mortgages more affordaable. \n",
    "* **The catalysts included**:\n",
    "   * Measures included a broadening of the eligible sources of funds for the minimum down payment\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum LTV ratio that triggers mandatory insurance to 80 percent\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum LTV ratio for any new government backed insured loans to 100 percent\n",
    "   * increasing the maximum amortization period from 25 to 40 years; and providing insurance on interest-only mortgages and on mortgages to the self-employed\n",
    "* ALong with tightening mortgage insurance rules:\n",
    "    * microprudential measures: Decrease LTV to 95%\n",
    "    * Oversight of mortgages insurers. \n",
    "    * Limits on MBS and CMHC securitization. Prohibit use of government-backed insured mortgages in non-cmhc securitization programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "__B. Assessing the Effectiveness of Macroprudential Measures__\n",
    "* Estimate two separate equations for mortgage credit and house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Y_t = \\alpha + \\beta X_t + \\gamma D_{t}^i + \\epsilon_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * $Y_t$ is mortgage credit or house price YoY growth.\n",
    "    * $X_t$ is a matrix of control variables (Current and lagged)\n",
    "    * $D_{t}^i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 in months following implementation of a set of measure i where i represents a specific set of macroprudential measures. \n",
    "* The model found that 2nd,3rd, and 4th rounds of measures helped to limit the increase in household leverage and house prices. \n",
    "* Evidence suggests that last 3 rounds of measures dampened mortgage credit growth aand house prices. \n",
    "* Reducing mortgage growth, tightening of mortgage insurance rules also dampened house price growth. \n",
    "* Tightening LTVs for new mortgage and for refinancing loans had the largest impact. \n",
    "* While debt to income ratio increased, it would've been higher otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "__IV. What If More Needs To Be Done__ \n",
    "* Caps on LTV. \n",
    "* DTI ratio and provisioning requirement and risk weights. \n",
    "* DTI ratio is mainly used to constrain huseholds capacity to borrow. \n",
    "* Provisions increasing in an upturn can constrain credit of the bank and also withstand lossess upon a downturn. \n",
    "* __Four Main Macroprudential Measures__\n",
    "    1. Limits on LTV\n",
    "    2. Caaps to debt to income ratio\n",
    "    3. Greater risk weights for banks' credit assets\n",
    "    4. Higher provisioning requirements for banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* LTV, DTI, and risk weights can be effective measures for containing mortgage credit and house prices growth. Quarterly credit growth is lower by 1/2 ~ 3/4 percentage points on average during the period of tightening. \n",
    "* The reason for those effects is most likely due to direct impacts on a bank's balance sheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "__V. Housing Finance Reform Over The Medium Term__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit risk transfeer to taxpapers: Advantages of government-backed mortgage insurance. \n",
    "    (i) Explicit allocation of losses which encourages actions to mitigate the risks. \n",
    "    (ii) Macroprudential tool (Mortgage insurance rules)\n",
    "    (iii) A small vehicle for small mortgage lenders to obtain funding. \n",
    "* Some of the issues with government backed mortgage insurance: \n",
    "    (i) Substantial risk tothe tax payer. \n",
    "    (ii) Not a level playing ground for mortgage insurers (private). \n",
    "    (iii) Inefficient allocation of resources. \n",
    "* A solution can be to grow the share of private insurers. Another solution could be risk sharing. Mortgage insurance could be limited to be the first 10-30% of the outstanding balance. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Conclusion__\n",
    "* One % lower in max LTV => reduces mortgage credit growth by about 1/4 to 1/2 percentage points. \n",
    "* Higher DT and higher risk weights could be an effective measure of slowing down mortgage credit growth. \n",
    "* Key vulnerabilities in the economy are high household debt and elevated house prices. \n",
    "* Considering to eliminate the role of government mortgagee insurance can be taken into consideration. \n",

    "## Bank activity and funding strategies: The impact on risk and returns\n",
    "* Authors: Asli Demirguc-Kunt, Harry Huizinga \n",
    "* Publication: Jounral of Financial Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper examines the implications of bank activity and short-term funding strategies for bank risk and return using an international sample of 1,334 banks in 101 countries leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Expansion into noninterest income-generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it could offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Nondeposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of nondeposit funding. A sizable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of nondeposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility. Overall, banking strategies that rely prominently on generating noninterest income or attracting nondeposit funding are very risky, consistent with the demise of the US investment banking sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Funding short-term strategies with trading increases inherent risk of the assets being funded. \n",
    "* This comes at the cost of bank fragility. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks have diversified their product offerings by consolidating businesses that were otherwise independent. For example, investment banks stood alone in their own business. Now, we see investment banks owned by large banks, along with commercial banks and insurance firms. This allows to diversify against adverse shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks that were the most deeply in trouble were the ones that generated substantial noninterest income through trading of, for instance, MBS or relied on wholesale capital markets for their funding.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large fast growing banks tend to have higher non-interest income and nondeposit funding shares. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Paper objective is to provide evidence on what funding strategies and bank income perform well in terms of producing profitable and stable banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Suggests that low levels of noninterest income and nondeposit funding, there oculd be some risk diversification benefits of icnreases these shares. Higher levels of noninterest income and nondeposit shares, further increases bank risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "* IV Regression: Paper instruments for bank income and funding mixes as a proxy for bank-specific banking powers and allowed activities. Risk outcomes and funding strategies and return outcomes can be determined simultaneously. \n",
    "    * Results show that higher noninterest income or nondeposit funding share engenders a materially higher bank risk, but the impact of either variable on the ROA is difficult to establish due to endogeneity. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Banking strategies that rely on noninterest income or nondeposit funding are very risky. \n",

    "## CoCos: a primer\n",
    "* Authors: Stefan Avdjiev, Anastasia Kartasheva, Bilyana Bogdanova\n",
    "* Publication: Bank for International Settlements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract / Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingent convertible capital instruments (CoCos) are hybrid capital securities that absorb losses when the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level. In this article, we go over the structure of CoCos, trace the evolution of their issuance, and examine their pricing in primary and secondary markets. CoCo issuance is primarily driven by their potential to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. The bulk of the demand for CoCos has come from small\n",
    "investors, while institutional investors have been relatively restrained so far. The spreads of CoCos over other subordinated debt greatly depend on their two main design characteristics – the trigger level and the loss absorption mechanism. CoCo spreads are more correlated with the spreads of other subordinated debt than with CDS spreads and equity prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cocos address the problem of a lack of incentive for private investors to provide additional capital in times of distress, which at that point governments use tax-payer money and distorts the incentives of bankers. \n",
    "* When the capital of the issuing bank falls below a certain level, debt level is lowered. \n",
    "* Looks at dataset that covers 70bn worth of CoCos issued between June 2009 and June 2013. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasons for issuing CoCos \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Satisfies regulatory capital requirements \n",
    "2. Demand comes from private banks and retail investors. \n",
    "3. Tend to yield more thna higher ranked debt and are highly dependent on trigger level and loss absorption. \n",
    "4. CoCos tend to be more correlated with those of other subordinated debt than with CDS spreads and equity prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure and design of CoCos \n",
    "\n",
    "__Requirements__ \n",
    "* They need to absorb lossess prior or at the point of insolvency. \n",
    "* The loss absorption mechanism must be a function fo the capitalisation levels of thee issuing bank. \n",
    "* Robust to price manipulation and speculative attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "__TWO MAIN DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS__ \n",
    "1. Loss absorption mechanism\n",
    "    * Converting into common equity or by suffering a principal writedown. \n",
    "2. Trigger to activate that mechanism \n",
    "    * Trigger can be mechanical (defined in terms of capital ratio) or discretionary (supervisory judgement).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Triggers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on mechanical rules or supervisors' discretion.\n",
    "    * EG: Capital falls below a certain % of RWA. Can be based on book value or market value. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Accounting Triggers_: Book value triggers. Set contractually based on BV of CET1 capital as a ratio of RWA. Depends heavily on the frequency of disclosure and calculations. May not be activated in a timely manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Market-Value Trigger_: Set to min ratio at the bank's stock market cap to its assets. Reduces scope for sheet manipulation and regulatory forbearance. Subject to stock price manipulation. Dilutive conversion rate makes it possible for more than one pair of equity prices to exist for any combination of bank asset values and non-CoCo debt levels => double equilibria problem. There is also an incentive to shortsell underlying asset to trigger. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Discretionary Triggers_: Point of non-viability (PONV) triggers are triggered based on supervisors' judgement about the bank's solvency prospects. Unless disclosure is made clear, uncertainty around timing looms over. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Structure of Cocos](CoCos_Structurepng.png \"CoCos Structure\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss absorption Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "CoCos boost the bank's equity in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conversion-to-equity CoCo: Turns into CET1 at a pre-defined conversion rate. \n",
    "    i. Conversion rate based on market price of stock at time triggered.\n",
    "    ii. Pre-specified price. \n",
    "    iii. Combination of the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Principal Writedown (PWD): CoCo raises equity by incurring a writedown. \n",
    "    * Full or partial writedown feature. EG: 75% FV and 25% cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that CE CoCos with a combination would incentivize existing equity holders to avoid a breach of the trigger while preventing unlimited dilution. (i causes dilution, ii lacks incentive to avoid triggers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### CoCo Issuance\n",
    "\n",
    "* Under Basel III, qualifies as either AT1 or T2 capital. \n",
    "    * Requires a PONV trigger requirement. \n",
    "    * Requires a going-concern contingent capital requirement, which only applies to AT1 instruments classified as liabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Basel III CoCos](CoCo_BaselIII.png \"CoCo Basel III\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selection for trigger is a tradeoff between regulatory capital eligibility considerations and costs of issuance. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lower triggers => usually less likely to qualify as AT1 capital (since lower loss absorbency). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Minimum trigger as AT1 capital is 5.125%__\n",
    "\n",
    "* AT1 instruments must be perpetual, that is why a third of all CoCos have no maturity date. Dated maturity CoCos are T2. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Capital eligibility considerations not as important in the selection of loss absorption mechanisms__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* CE is more popular.\n",
    "    * Usually cheaper issuance than PWD. \n",
    "* Tax implications across jurisdictions vary with CoCos. Some see it as debt, in which interest expense is associated. \n",
    "\n",
    "* 64% of CoCos are tax-deductible, 20% are not, 16% under review. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Investors in CoCos \n",
    "\n",
    "* Retail investors and small private banks primarily. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lack of completee consistent ratings is the primary issue supressing growth of the investor base. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Investor Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "__Demand Side___\n",
    "1. Retail Investors and private banks in Asia and Europe.\n",
    "2. US institutional investors.\n",
    "3. European non-bank financial institutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Combined of 13bn.\n",
    "* Private banks ( 52% of demand )\n",
    "* AM companies ( 27% of demand )\n",
    "* Hedge Funds ( 9% of demand )\n",
    "* Banks ( 3% of demand )\n",
    "\n",
    "### Factors influencing the size of the CoCo investor base\n",
    "\n",
    "* Absence of credit ratings. Institutional invesetors are against mandates that prevent them from holding instruments without credit ratings. Three main factors why there are no ratings: \n",
    "    * Heterogeneity across jurisdictions. \n",
    "    * High-trigger CoCos can invert the hierarchy of investors. \n",
    "    * Discretionary triggers create valuation uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Usually rated much lower than subordinated debt and senior unsecured debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Diversification benefits if tail risk has low correlation with the portfolios of CoCo bondholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary market pricing of CoCos\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Determinants of Pricing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trigger\n",
    "2. Loss absorption mechanism\n",
    "3. Capital structure of the bank \n",
    "\n",
    "* Yields are consistent with bank capital structure. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Authors: Chris D'Souza and Toni Gravelle from BOC, Walter Engert and Liane Orsi from OSFI. \n",
    "* Publication: Bank of Canada and OSFI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Policy makers were unwilling to allow institutions to fail. \n",
    "* Concerns arose regarding excessive risk-taking behaviour by protected institutions. \n",
    "* Paper looks at two potential resolutions of failing banks: contingent capital and bail-in debt. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Contingent Capital and Bail-In Debt? \n",
    "\n",
    "_Contingent Capital_: Subordinated security, similar to that of a preferred share or subordinated debenture, that converts to common equity under certain conditions. => Conversion terms are set out in the contracts made between the issuer and investor. Require payment for taking on the risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Bail-In Debt_: Contractual mechanism extended beyond the regulatory capital base to senior debt securities of the issuing bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Gone-Concern and Going-concern Contingent Instruments__\n",
    "\n",
    "Contingent Capital is categorized into two main types of instruments: \n",
    "\n",
    "_Gone-Concern_: Supervisor determines whether the financial condition (or PONV) warrents conversion to common equity. Offers itself to the resolution framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Going-Concern_: Converts before PoNV. Usually if capital ratio hits a certain point or share price falls below a certain level or aggregate banking sector falls. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regulatory context matters\n",
    "\n",
    "With gone-concern capital, the incentives of the supervisor and resolution authority to intervene in a timely manner matters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going-concern => works to exercise forebearance. Tendency of som esupervisors to accomodate troubled institutions and to refrain from intervening with corrective measures. Usually happens due to lack of incentives or power to intervene effectively as the bank deteriorates. Basically, reduces supervisory forebearance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives of gone-concern contingent instruments \n",
    "\n",
    "Gone-concern contingent capital and bain-in debt share two objectives: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) To support the resolution of a failing bank by providing sources of capital when the institution cannot recapitalize through private markets; and \n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) to ensure that equity holders and other providers of regulatory capital, as well as major creditors of banks, face risk of loss, even if the troubled bank is not closed and liquidated. \n",
    "\n",
    "These mechanisms can reduce the liklihood of a bailout and reduce cost to taxpayers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How would gone-concern contingent instruments help resolution? \n",
    "\n",
    "We first note the conditions for conversion: \n",
    "\n",
    "(i) Reach PoNV; or\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Public sector provides capital, without which the bank would not be viable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gone-concern capital might not be enough to generate sufficient capital. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at bail-in debt: \n",
    "* Could increase the private sector capital available at PoNV. \n",
    "* Most senior debt would tend to be unchanged if conversion triggered. \n",
    "* We could use both bail-in and contingent instruments, alongside existing prudential capital requirements, for restoration requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-viability and supervisory discretion\n",
    "\n",
    "The OSFI can intervene and essentially act as a supervisor if, under discretion, finds a bank to be failing. Can activate trigger on their own discretion. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Several issues concerning contingent capital and bail-in senior debt require further analysis, including the precise form of any prudential rules to bring these mechanisms into effect; the amount of such contingent instruments to require; and the determination of the period over which such requirements would become binding. Other issues include how these mechanisms would relate to other tools in the regulators’ resolution toolkit; their incentive effects on market participants, including when conversion seems likely; and the implications for investors holding instruments that are not subject to conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues should be addressed as policy-makers around the world continue to debate the set of tools to be included in an effective framework for bank resolution. The framework should recognize the possibility that financial firms can fail, and that they need to be resolved efficiently, in a way that minimizes disruption to the wider economy and reduces the risk of moral hazard. Relying on higher prudential requirements for common equity is undoubtedly part of the solution, as was recently proposed by the Basel Committee. In addition, contingent capital and bail-in debt could improve the capacity of the private sector to contribute to the resolution of failing banks while reducing risks to the public sector and improving the incentives that condition market behaviour."

    "\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "Originally, a bank's ability to weather through financial crisis, or have a capital buffer, was determined by a ratio of assets and liabilities. Now, we look at liquidity as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main questions targetted in the paper: \n",
    "\n",
    "* What is liquidity at a bank?\n",
    "* Why do we care about it?\n",
    "* Why are banks prone to runs?\n",
    "* How can banks achieve adequate liquidity?\n",
    "* How much liquidity is enough?\n",

    "* Can we distinguish between solvency and liquidity? How?\n",
    "* How do liquidity requirements, capital requirements, and bank resolution rules interact?\n",
    "* How have bank liquidity levels changed in recent years?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is liquidity at a bank? \n",
    "\n",
    "* The ability to find cash it may need to meet demands upon it. \n",
    "* Currency or cash or on account at the Fed Res or Central Bank\n",
    "* Largest commitment is to return demand deposits. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we care about it? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks are fragile in nature without sufficient safety margins (capital ratio, SLR, etc). \n",
    "* Asset illiquidity (credit freeze) cannot mitigate the risk/loss associated with fire-sales and bank runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are banks prone to runs? \n",
    "* Banks purpose is maturity transformation, also known as time intermediation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__time intermediation__: Take deposits and other short-term funds and lend them back out at longer-maturities. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Generally, banks can meet this obligation. \n",
    "* Problem arises with lost confidence, \"en masse\". \n",
    "* CDIC helps mitigate the risk of a bank run by restoring a level of confidence during times of financial distress. \n",
    "* Modern banks heavily rely on short-term lending, or time intermediation, and so borrowings/liquidity in capital markets matter. \n",
    "* Being unable to roll over short-term loans becomes a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How can banks achieve adequate liquidity?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shorten asset maturities\n",
    "    * Shorter maturities allow for meeting cash demands during periods of cash-crunches. \n",
    "2. Improve the average liquidity of assets\n",
    "    * Credit worthy securities and those with higher volumes tend to be more liquid. Securities tend to be more liquid, with associated risk of course. \n",
    "3. Lengthen liability maturities\n",
    "    * Basically, extend the loans you owe etc. \n",
    "4. Issue more equity\n",
    "    * Common stock = perpeutual maturity. \n",
    "    * No interest needs to be paid\n",
    "5. Reduce contingent commitments\n",
    "    * Cut back on borrowing volumes of lines of credits etc. \n",
    "6. Obtain liquidity protection\n",
    "    * Can pay another bank or insurer for the guarantee of cash in the future, collateralized to the bank's assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Yield Curves__\n",
    "\n",
    "_Upward Sloping Yield Curve_: This is the most typical shape of the yield curve. This suggests that shortening maturities decreases investment income and lengthening liability maturities raises interest expense. More liquid instruments tend to have lower yields => reduce investment income. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Equity tends to be more expensive than debt and so liquidity protection comes at a cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How much liquidity is enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks estimate tail end losses in their models but try to maintain a certain level of capital to meet credit rating targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the economic value of maturity transformation? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Note higher liquidity will result in higher safety, but more fragility of the banks. \n",
    "* Added costs to liquidity will be passed onto the borrowers and consumers. \n",
    "* Why do we need maturity transformation? It serves to our preferences for liquidity and need for longer-term investment funds. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Diamond and Dybvig(1983)_: Case for maturity transformation - driven by desire of consumers and businesses for a high level of liquidity for a significant part of their assets. Allowing investors to invest in illiquid assets, while allowing them to withdraw at once is a productive activity. Allows the economy to benefit without foregoing illiquid investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "__ESSENTIALLY, pay off between short-term contingencies with the pay offs of long-term commitments__\n",
    "\n",
    "_Calomiris and Kahn (1991)_: Argues that demandable debt overcomes agency problems and provides the right incentives for bank management and shareholders. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Some argue against maturity transformation's value__ \n",
    "* Risk > reward. Need for mat transformation to support the non-financial economy is not large. \n",
    "* Incentivizes lenders to shorten maturity to increase seniority in the event of fin distress. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the new liquidity requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "__BASEL III__\n",
    "* Two main ratios \n",
    "1. Liquidity Coverage Ratio \n",
    "Stress test to ensure bank would survive a 30 day market crisis. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Net Stable Funding Ratio\n",
    "Ensures assets supported by stable funding sources. Essentially stops banks from excessive maturity transformation in a risky manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the liquidity coverage ratio work \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ LCR = \\frac{\\text{high quality liquid assets}}{\\text{projected cash claims over the next 30 days}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specifies the percentage of liabilities with an indefinite maturity. \n",
    "* Retail deposits tend to be \"sticky\" and not move\n",
    "* Corporate is less \"sticky\" \n",
    "* Banks requried to maintain 100% or more LCR\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the policy issues around the LCR\n",
    "1. Global approach does not consider local differences. \n",
    "2. Simplified formula of LCR cannot approximate the true stress test closely to be useful without providing distorted incentives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other more specific concerns: \n",
    "* 30-day time period\n",
    "* Weights assigned to assets, liabs, and off balance sheet items. \n",
    "* Assumption of large liquid fin markets, esp for govt bonds. \n",
    "* L1 and L2 asset breakdown\n",
    "* Overall calibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 30-day time period\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reflects belief of the time it takes for central banks and authorities to counter a severe crisis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific weighting assigned to assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet items. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Since LCR resulted in loans and line of credit volume to be drawn down, itmakes it difficult to provide liquidity backstops that large corporate customers vaalue and find difficult to obtain elsewhere. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of large liquid financial markets, especially for government bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Smaller nations have lower national debts and therefore, less bonds and bills to be held as liquid assets. Limited supply of liquidity. \n",
    "* The fix is creating committed central bank facilities to lend as needed against pre-positioned collateral from banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Breakdown between level 1 and level 2 assets\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arguments about securities that could qualify as level 1 capital. EG: Freddie Mae stocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Covered bonds in europe and other nations see it as level 1 however, BASEL prevents this due to interconnectedness between banks under the covered bonds. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall calibrations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Average across banks was approximately 100% (72% of banks had at least 100% LCR) \n",
    "* When a depositor demands a dollar, both the numerator and the denominator will go down during times of crisis, counterbalancing to some extent. \n",
    "* What matters is what type of of asset was used to repay the liability and what costs of liquidation were incurred. \n",
    "* Real concern is total cash outflows and inflows are worse than assumed in the LCR calculations. \n",
    "* Strong arguments to allow the LCR to fall below 100% during times of crisis. However, this may incite adverse market reactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the Net Stable Funding Ratio work? \n",
    "\n",
    "$$NSFR = \\frac{\\text{Stable sources of funds}}{\\text{level of assets adjusted for ability to be liquidated}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "_Stable Sources_: T1 & T2 capital, pref shares, liabilities with maturities over 1 year, and proportion of those with shorter maturities such as deman deposits (depending on 'stickiness'). \n",
    "\n",
    "* NSFR required to remain above 100% with flexibility in crisis and a buffer as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the policy issues around the NSFR\n",
    "\n",
    "_What is the point?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent banks from performing an excessive amount of maturity transformation by making too many illiquid long-term loans and investments funded with volatile short-term money. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Viewed as the ONE-YEAR stress test.\n",
    "* Difficult to balance the social value (risk vs reward). \n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the Fed's comprehensive liquidity analysis and review work? \n",
    "\n",
    "__CLAR__: Multi-dimensional process to complementing standardized ratios of LCR and NSFR.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this work: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detailed bank-run liquidity stress test: Looks at clients, funders, counterparties and their behaviours. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independent fed review of the bank's analysis: Fed may alter outcomes and correct biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Fed evaluation of the bank's liquidity planning process and their governance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the role of central banks like the federal reserve in providing liquidity? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Original purpose was to act as \"lender of last resort\" \n",
    "* Now managers of monetary policy. \n",
    "* Halts bank runs by providing lending against sound collateral, where the lending is used to payout claims in crisis. \n",
    "* Difficulty in placing value of assets can raise the risk of a solvent bank not receiving the funding it needs due to misunderstanding about its assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Can we distinguish between solvency and liquidity? How? \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we tell when illiquidity is a symptom of an insolvent bank? Or when a bank is illiquid but solvent? Short answer: hard to tell but we can get close. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is in: \n",
    "1. Calculating asset liquidation and future values. \n",
    "2. Liabilities that are more complex (derivatives, pension defecits, or contingent commitments). \n",
    "\n",
    "Main questions to ask: \n",
    "1. Book value or market value? \n",
    "    * Values should be updated based on market condition and worth under normal market conditions.\n",
    "    * Book value comes closer however, it is slow. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Which standards are chosen. \n",
    "    * Accounting standards => Slow\n",
    "    * Market => Over react. \n",
    "    * Some instruments hard to value. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### How do liquidity requirements, capital requirements, and bank resolution rules interact? \n",
    "\n",
    "Most strongly interacting: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The capital requirements for banks\n",
    "(2) The rules governing the resolution of troubled banks y winding them up or restructuring or selling them. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Capital requirement constraints push banks into riskier higher yielding assets with less liquidity. Risk-sensitive capital requirements would mitigate this. \n",
    "* If regulation allows for banks to arrive at resolution with not much problem, safety benefits of higher liquidity levels are thwarted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How have hbank liquidity levels changed in recent years? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Reliance on wholesale funding dropped 1/3rd from 2008 peak to 2012. \n",
    "* Fell from about 30% of total funding to 18%. \n",
    "* Commercial banks became significant net users of short-term funding prior to the crisis to net suppliers in recent years. \n",
    "* Volume of short-term liabilities minus short-term assets fell from 10% to -6%. \n",

    "### Main Points\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explains how majority of money is created by commercial banks making loans. \n",
    "2. Banks do not multiply up central bank money nor simply act as intermediaries. \n",
    "3. Money creation depends on monetary policy, usually through interest rates. This can be done through purchasing assest or quantitative easing. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Whenever a (commercial) bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower's bank account, thereby creating new money.__ \n",

    "\n",
    "__The real way...__\n",
    "* Banks lend out loans which then in turn create deposits. \n",
    "* Money is not multiplied in normal times and the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation, nor is it multiplied up to make more loans and deposits. \n",

    "__What's the point of the article?__\n",
    "\n",
    "Reserves cannot be multiplied into more loans and deposits and how these reserves do not represent 'free money' for banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two misconceptions about money creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Banks simply act as intermediaries, lending out the deposits that savers place with them. \n",
    "    * Commercial banks create deposits, counter to our intuition. They lend and generate deposits. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The central bank determines the quantity of loans and deposits in the economy by controlling the quantity of central bank money - so-called 'money multiplier approach'\n",
    "    * For this to be true, reserves must be binding constraint on lending and CB must directly determine the reserves. \n",
    "    * CBs actually control price of reserves not the quantity. AKA interest rates, which goes against this statement. \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Money Creation in Reality\n",
    "\n",
    "SHORT ANSWER: Lending creates deposits, broad money determination at the aggregate level. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Broad Money_: Money held by households and companies in the economy. Made up of deposits. \n",
    "\n",
    "* An example: When mortgages are issued, bank credits the account with a bank deposit of the size of the mortgage, thereby creating new money. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Both assets and liabilities for consumers and commercial banks increase with money creation, however the central bank remains unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Aggregate __quantity__ of reserves does not constrain the amount of bank lending. \n",

    "Quantitative easing is one way to create money: buy bonds, put deposits into the accounts of private sector agents (sellers). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Money Destruction__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Issuance of LT debt and equity by banks. The private sector agents pay for these debentures which reduces their deposits. This reduces the liabilities on the banking sector's balance sheet and increases their non-deposit liabilities. \n",

    "\n",
    "INTEREST RATES and FEES charged by the banks are main constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "__3 MAIN CONSTRAINTS TO MONEY CREATION__ \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Banks themselves face limits on how much they can lend. \n",
    "    * Market forces. Profitably lending in a competitive market. \n",
    "    * Mitigate risks with lending. \n",
    "    * Regulatory constraints regarding build-up of risks from banks' activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Money creation is also constrained by the behaviour of the money holders - households and businesses. \n",
    "    * EG: Borrowers (households for example) use lended money to destroy it (pay back debt).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The ultimate constraint on money creation is monetary policy. \n",
    "    * Interest rates affect borrowers and lenders. ALso through transmission mechanisms such as inflation => reduce/increase demand for deposits. \n",
    "    \n",
    "__Extensions about the three constraints__ \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Market Forces Facing Individual Banks\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Banks need to profitably earn a spread between their assets and liabs. \n",
    "    * To do so considers risks of over lending and staying profitable. \n",
    "    * Reducing spread is favorable for competition. \n",
    "    * These factors dictate the quantity of money creation. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Transmissions](Transmission_of_Deposit_Creation.png 'Transmission')\n",
    "\n",
    "* Managing Risks Associated with Creating Loans\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Attract stable deposits to reduce risk of demand for deposits. \n",
    "    * Faces liquidity risk. Essentially, loan out but demands decrease upon demand. \n",
    "    * Banks guard against liquidity risk by issuing long-term liabilities but that destroys money creation. \n",
    "    * Also limited by __credit risk__: The risk of lending to borrowers that turn out to be unable to repay loans. Having sufficient capital mitigates part of this risk. \n",
    "    * We also note that if all banks were to decide to lend more money, some banks would lose deposits while also gaining deposits as a result of other banks making loans. \n",
    "    * Behaviour in an environment perceived to be less risk, can cause actions that create a fragile financial system. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Constraints arising from the response of households and companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* How people want to spend the money matters and also with the vigour in their demand for loans. \n",
    "\n",
    " __Reflux Theory__: Money can be destroyed if money is loaned to pay another institution's loans (consolidation loans).\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Another way is that money may pass to individuals who already have enough assets to cover. Excess money reduction is desired and so increased spending on goods and services occur (aka passed on spending). Does not create new money. \n",
    "\n",
    "BOTH theories are __'Hot Potato Effects'__. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ultimately, Monetary Policy (THE ULTIMATE CONSTRAINT ON MONEY CREATION)\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary goal: Keeping inflation at target. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Interest rate that the CB announces on reserves will effect the rate at which commercial banks can obtain money from the CB in which they are willing to lend on similar terms in other markets (sterling money markets for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Central banks do not typically choose a\n",
    "quantity of reserves to bring about the desired short-term\n",
    "interest rate. Rather, they focus on prices — setting\n",
    "interest rates__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demand for money is a consequence rather than a cause of banks making loans and creating broad money. This is because of profitability of a loan depends on many factors (int rate, risk, use of funds etc.) \n",
    "\n",
    "### QE - Creating broad money directly with monetary policy\n",
    "\n",
    "* When rates are cut by 0.5% and we meet an effective lower bound yet need to create more money in the economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "* QE shifts the focus to the quantity of money. \n",
    "\n",
    "* CB purchases assets in turn for government debt (gov bonds). \n",
    "\n",
    "### The link between QE and quantities of money\n",
    "\n",
    "![QE](QE.png \"Quantitative Easing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "* Government buys bonds and securities and the pension fund will now turn the government bonds it held into deposits. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The central bank now carries additional government debt as assets (govt bonds), which thereby increases reserves. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The CB gives the commercial bank an IOU for financing the purchase by crediting reserves to the pension fund's bank. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two misconception about how QE works\n",
    "\n",
    "People say QE is free money for banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Role of the commercial banks is to act as an intermediary to facilitate the transaction between the central bank and the pension fund (for example). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Banks have to pay interest on the pension fund's deposits which downplays the increased \"free interest revenue\" gained from commercial banks holding onto higher levels of reserves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the extra reserves are not multiplied up into new loans and broad money. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Reserves created in the banking sector (from QE) are not central to money creation since we cannot lend out reserves. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Loans are matched by deposits and so the amount of resserves does not change. \n",
    "\n",
    "* QE works by circumventing the banking sector, aiming to increase private sector spending directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This article has discussed how money is created in the modern\n",
    "economy. Most of the money in circulation is created, not by\n",
    "the printing presses of the Bank of England, but by the\n",
    "commercial banks themselves: banks create money whenever\n",
    "they lend to someone in the economy or buy an asset from\n",
    "consumers. And in contrast to descriptions found in some\n",
    "textbooks, the Bank of England does not directly control the\n",
    "quantity of either base or broad money. The Bank of England\n",
    "is nevertheless still able to influence the amount of money in\n",
    "the economy. It does so in normal times by setting monetary\n",
    "policy — through the interest rate that it pays on reserves held\n",
    "by commercial banks with the Bank of England. More\n",
    "recently, though, with Bank Rate constrained by the effective\n",
    "lower bound, the Bank of England’s asset purchase programme\n",
    "has sought to raise the quantity of broad money in circulation.\n",
    "This in turn affects the prices and quantities of a range of\n",
    "assets in the economy, including money. "

    "\n",
    "* Near lower bound for interest rates pushing fin institutions and central banks to pursue unconventional methods of stabilizing inflation expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit market intervention, QE, and liqudiity provisions are some to name a few .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "* Main systemic level concern was regarding liquidity. \n",
    "* Despite low economic growth, inflation spiked. \n",
    "* Despite the signs (Lack of inter-bank liquidity/lending and counterparty risk), solvency was not brought to question. \n",
    "* CB reacted by implementing liquidity providing operations such as adjustring interest rates. \n",
    "* Fed cut its rate aggressively while ECB raised its refinancing rates in the first year of the crisis. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Figure 1. Evolution of CB Assets and Policy Rates__\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: \n",
    "\n",
    "* The Fed Reserve increased lowered interest rates to the lower bound, increased credit market interventions, and increased liquidity interventions while selling government bonds in the very beginning of the crisis and buying them back later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Interest rates was insufficient to handle the crisis of 2008. Commercial banks tightened lending standards as markets went under stress, straining wholesale funding for banks. \n",
    "* Non-bank financing via private-label securitiziation came to a halt. \n",
    "* Stimulus released to bolster demand. \n",
    "* In response to all of this CBs increased size and scope of liquidity operations.\n",
    "* Some CBs engaged in QE , some made conditional commitments to keeping rates low. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Options for Unconventional Monetary Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are the lower bound...what can we do to provide monetary stimulus?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Commit to low interest rates and forward guidance to guiding long-term interest rates. \n",
    "    * Commitment to not withdrawing stimulus until recovery in sight. \n",
    "    * Keeps inflation from declining, prevents real interest rates rising and bolstering demands. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Monetary authorities provide liquidity to fin institutions to give them resources to on-lend to businessess and consumers. \n",
    "    * CBs can lend at longer maturities (refer to previous paper), and broaden the quality of collateral they'll accept for such lending. \n",
    "    * Enlarging the pool of the collateral accepted for CB operations, financing by the banks to the related sectors can be facilitated and could be reflected in the credit spreads that banks charge to these sectors\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. CB could seek to affect long-term interest rates across a wide range of financial assets by lowering RF rates through purchasing securities (bid up the price, bring yields down). \n",
    "    * Purchasing longer-term govt securities aims to reduce long-term private borrowing rates. Bond yields decline, interest rates in the lending market expected to decline (since treasuries are bgench marks for private-sector assets). CBs can hold onto this as reserves and earn zero or low interest if lending opportunities are bleak. \n",
    "    * Banks can use these proceeds to extend new credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Provide loans to nonfinancial corporations by purchasing private assets or furnishing loans (when investors have to pledge particular type of assets as collateral to obtain central bank loans). \n",
    "    * Alleviate trading conditions, reduce liquidity premiums, establish benchmark prices, and encourage origination in the targeted market through the purchase of commercial paper, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. \n",
    "    * Elgiibal securities to be posted as collateral and protects CB against losses. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Box 1. Nomenclature of unconventional measures \n",
    "\n",
    "* CE vs QE. \n",

    "\n",
    "__QE:__ Purchase of govt or private securities financed by creation of reserves. \n",
    "\n",
    "__CE:__ Acquisition of private assets in key markets. Does not expand blaance sheets depending on whether the impact on reserves is sterilized. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the drawbacks of each method? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Effectiveness hinges on credibility and only serves value in its restrictions of future options. If inflation erupts earlier, the central bank's credibility could be harmed. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does not translate to large amounts of credit provided to households and firms if banks are concerned about their capital adequacy, reducing size and risk in their BS, or averse due to weak economic back drop. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If LT securities accounts for a small portion of the bond market, they are ineffective. Even if yields fall, private rates might not materially change due to higher risk premiums.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Logistical challenges in targeting and selecting distressed markets and expose central bank to greater credit risk. They can also distort prices and hurt profitability of commercial banks and favor segments of the credit markets. \n",
