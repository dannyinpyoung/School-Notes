    "# Major Assignment Readings\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Feb 9th 2015, LTV limits introduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives are to: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dampen the pro-cyclical dynamics that could occur between property lending and house prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Strengthen resilience of banks and households to financial shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "These measures were introduced in a precautionary way to ensure that housing-market recovery would not be destabilised with a re-emergence of housing market speculation driven by credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many countries implemented LTV DTI or LTI restrictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What is the policy__ \n",
    "* 80% LTV cap for NFTB (non-first-time buyers) of PDHs (primary welling homes). \n",
    "* For first-time buyers (FTBs), a higher cap of 90% applies for the first 220,000 of the value of the home and then 80% LTV for anything above 220,000. \n",
    "* No more than 15% of new lending for PDHs is allowed above the caps. \n",
    "* 70% LTV for BTL (buy-to-let) purchases. \n",
    "* LTI maximum is 3.5. Up to 20% of new lending is allowed above this limit. \n",
    "* No LTI limit imposed on BTL and only applies to primary residences. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Exceptions to the measures__ \n",
    "1. Borrowers with negative equity and selling their home and purchasing a new one are exempt from LTV limits. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Switcher mortgages (borrowers changing mortgage provider with no increase in principal. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mortgages in arrears that are under restructuring with the mortgage providers. Switcher mortgages are exempt because the decision to move mortgage to a new provider does not increase the indebtedness of the borrower and does not restrict competition in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Why do we need to implement?__ \n",
    "* Boom-busts in the housing market reflects: \n",
    "1. Higher leverage for borrowers than is typically the case for other investment activities. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Speculative behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lags in supply response \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Slow pace of price discovery and illiquidity in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What happens with high LTVs and LTIs__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Contributes to harmful boom bust cycles in housing markets\n",
    "2. Weakening the resilience of banks and households to property market downturns. \n",
    "\n",
    "We find that LTV and LTI/DTI can be effective in reducing pro-cyclicality of house prices, credit, and leverage, and lowering default prob, and loss given default on mortgage credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Reducing Pro-cyclicality__ \n",
    "Increasing home value can allow for increased borrowing against the home value, which encourages pro-cyclicality. This can occur even in light of a LTV cap. However, LTV caps can limit the extent to pro-cyclicality. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What has literature found?__ \n",
    "\n",
    "LTV and LTI measures curb mortgage credit growth and reduce risk of house price bubbles emerging. \n",
    "\n",
    "See Lim et al. (2011). Finds that DTI is more effective in reducing housing credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Macroprudential policies work better in boom phases than in busts. \n",
    "\n",
    "These measures reduce asset growth for banks during upswings and and stops declines in asset growth during contractionary periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "LTV caps effective in slowing mortgage credit growth and house price appreciation. They found that a 10% increase in LTV ratio is associated with a 13% increase in nominal house prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Duca et al (2010) finds that a 8-11% increase in house prices from 10% increase in LTV for FTBs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ahuja and Nabar (2011) find that reductions in LTV contributes to reductions in transaction volume and price growth with a lag and suggest that LTV tightening could affect property activitiy through the expectations channel rather than through the credit channel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Igan and Kang (2011) consider the expectations channel for these instruments and finds tighter limits on LTVs curb expectations and speculative incentives. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Enhancing Resilience__ \n",
    "\n",
    "If repayment burdens are high, modest changes in house prices can increase the risk of default among borrowers. \n",
    "\n",
    "High LTV make it likely for borrowers to fall into negative equity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Loss given default for banks would be higher too with higher LTV caps. \n",
    "\n",
    "LTIs might be more effective in limiting a build-up phase since incomes tend to increase more slowly than housing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of default is reduced by an effect of both LTI and LTV restrictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "LTI provides buffer against employment shocks while LTV reduce borrowers incentive to default when house prices decline. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding loss given default, restrictions provide a collateral buffer against house price declines. Lowers the loss in the event of default. \n",
    "\n",
    "LTV without LTI => Borrowers capacity to service mortgages are vulnerable to income shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "LTI without LTV => Banks are exposed to severe house price shocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "One major disagreement for the PDH LTV limits included risks that borrowers might seek unsecured lending to increase their deposit to meet the LTV limits and inappropriate timing due to the stageo f the economic cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Proportionate Caps__\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: \n",
    "\n",
    "* 20% of new mortgage lending allowed 3.5x LTI and above.\n",
    "* 15% is allowed at LTV above the threshold for PDHs. \n",
    "* 10% at LTVs above threshold for BTLs. \n",
    "\n",
    "_When is lTV and LTI being higher better?_\n",
    "* Creditworthy borrowers who cannot raise the deposit required but would be able to afford the loan payments. \n",
    "* Younger borrowers whose incomes are reasonably expected to rise in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "__First time buyers__ \n",
    "* Subject to same LTI limits as other borrowers, just with exceptions on the first 220,000 value of the home @ LTV of max 90%. \n",
    "* Shows graph of LTV limits for FTB. Good to look at. \n",
    "* Distribution of new lending by FTB house prices is good to look at. \n",
    "* Kelly et al (2015) find that prob of default for FTBs is lower by 4% on average at a maximum for LTVs of 80-85%. \n",
    "    * Two possibel reasons for this:\n",
    "    1. FTBs want to maintain credit rating due to it being their first large loan. \n",
    "    2. Could be due to risk appetite. Due to FTBs likely having funding their downpayments using capital gains, there is a greater attachment to their property. \n",
    "    * The bank's perspective is that due to lack of credit history, the banks will be more stringent to FTBs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Expected loss = Value of Loan at time of default * prob of default * loss given default\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving FTBs straight up 90% LTV did not meet the second objective, which was to dampen pro-cyclicality. By controlling LTVs, it reduces the risk of price/credit cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "__BTL Borrowers__\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lending above 80% LTV was extremely low and almost 70% of all borrowers were under 70% LTV although the volume was low in this sector. \n",
    "\n",
    "* BTL is exempt from LTI requirements. This is because mortgage repayment is less affected by non-rental income than it is about the future income streams of the new property. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Because it is difficult to regulate this, DTI (debt to income caps) are essential taking into account potential rental income. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Dampening Pro-cyclicaality__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* BTL transactions accoutned for a quarter of all transactions during the boom. BTL lending is positively correlated with the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Share of BTL lending is positively correlated with overvaluation in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Increasing Resilience__\n",
    "\n",
    "LTV limits for non-owner occupier borrowers more often were used to counter pro-cyclicality. Lending to BTL is riskier in downturns than occupiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "BTL borowers are more likely to default compared to PDH borrowers. \n",
    "\n",
    "BTL default rate is 10% higher at originating LTV Of 70%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assumed 25% more riskiness base efault probability for mortgages collateralised with investment properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kinds of buyers have little incentive to protect their primary residence from default. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Negative Equity Borrowers__ \n",
    "\n",
    "* 40% of outstanding loans were in negative equity. \n",
    "* LTV caps during this time can lead to borrowers being trapped in their homes and reducing labor market mobility along with consumption and savings. \n",
    "* "
